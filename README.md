# Spam Classifier Project

This repository contains the implementation of a Spam Classifier using Python. The goal of this project is to classify emails or messages as "spam" or "ham" (not spam) using various machine learning techniques. The project involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Introduction

Spam classification is a common task in natural language processing (NLP) and is essential for filtering unwanted emails and messages. This project utilizes Python and various machine learning libraries to build a model that can accurately distinguish between spam and ham.

## Features

- Preprocessing of raw text data
- Feature extraction using techniques such as TF-IDF or word embeddings
- Implementation of various machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, etc.)
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal model performance
- Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualization of results

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-classifier.git
    cd spam-classifier
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To use the spam classifier, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have installed all dependencies.
2. Prepare your dataset or use the sample dataset provided.
3. Run the `train.py` script to train the model:

    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

4. Run the `predict.py` script to classify new messages:

    ```bash
    python predict.py --message "Your message here"
    ```

## Datasets

The project uses publicly available datasets such as the [UCI Machine Learning Repository's SMS Spam Collection](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection) or [Enron Email Dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/). You can also use your own datasets by placing them in the `data/` directory.

## Model Training

The training process involves:

- Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
- Extracting features using TF-IDF or other feature extraction methods.
- Training various machine learning models.
- Evaluating models using different metrics to select the best one.

## Evaluation

The trained models are evaluated using metrics like:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

You can find the evaluation results and plots in the `results/` directory.
